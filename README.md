# Aiden Tsen Portfolio Site

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub! This is a WIP portfolio site that I will be working on as and when I have the time and inclination to do so

# Things for me to work on

index.html contents
- Good image of self to use
- Write About Me
- Fill out Portfolio with the 6561 game at least
- Complete contact information section (should coincide with LinkedIn update)

Other
- CSS
- Look into functionality to automatically link in projects that I host on GitHub pages?

# Technologies used
Intent is to create v1.0 of this in pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. No installations required
